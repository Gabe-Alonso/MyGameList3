# MyGameList

This app will be a way of keeping track of games someone have played, while also allowing them to review
each game. The written review will only appear when the game is clicked on while a 5 star rating
appears next to the name in the recycler view preview. Users can specify whether they actually finished
it or not, which will have an updating icon next to the 5 star review. Users will be able to add in games
by clicking on a button that adds items to the recycler view that represents a new game to keep track of
and be reviewed.

Concepts used:
